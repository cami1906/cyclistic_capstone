This is the SQL script used to import, compile and analyse the Cyclistic Case 
Study for the Capstone Project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

It uses the data from Divvy Bikes (https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data).

The data used in this case study is located in the cloud of Amazon Web Services

I followed the next steps:

1. Download the individual CSV documents
2. Import each into separate tables, regularising data types
3. Combine all the data into one table
4. Inspect data for anomalies
5. Identify and exclude data with anomalies
6. Create queries for data visualisations
